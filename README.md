# Music Recommendation Web App

A web app built with React, using machine learning to suggest personalized music based on users' Spotify listening history.

## Features

- üéµ **Personalized Music Recommendations**: Recommends songs tailored to users' listening patterns.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Algorithm**: Uses an algorithm to predict music preferences based on historical data.
